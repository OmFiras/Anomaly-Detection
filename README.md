# Anomaly-Detection
An anomaly detection system which is used to classify and  compare the risk with standard performance measure for any specific problem given by the user.

It uses k-means clustering algorithm to form clusters of the data along with principal component analysis to reduce dimension in order to visualize and enhance the anomaly detection and then apply minimum covariance determinant algorithm to perform outlier detection.

### Dataset Used

Various datasets from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) are used to test the given anomaly detection system.
